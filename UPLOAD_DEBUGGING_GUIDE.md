# 🔧 Upload System Debugging Guide

## 🐛 **Current Issue**
The upload system is returning a 404 error when trying to access uploaded files.

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### **1. Check Authentication**
- Open browser console and look for "Auth token: Present/Missing"
- If missing, user needs to log in again
- If present, token might be expired

### **2. Check Backend Logs**
Look for these console messages in the backend terminal:
```
Upload additional photo request received
File: [file object]
User: [user object]
Processing additional photo for user: [userId] with file: [fileUrl]
```

### **3. Check File Upload**
- Verify file is being saved to correct directory
- Check if file path is being generated correctly
- Ensure static file serving is working

### **4. Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: 404 File Not Found**
**Cause**: File uploaded but not accessible via URL
**Solution**: 
1. Check if file exists in `uploads/additional-photos/` directory
2. Verify static file serving middleware is working
3. Check file permissions

#### **Issue: Authentication Error**
**Cause**: Token missing or expired
**Solution**:
1. User needs to log in again
2. Check if token is being sent in request headers

#### **Issue: Multer Error**
**Cause**: File type or size validation failed
**Solution**:
1. Check file type (must be JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. Check file size (must be < 10MB)
3. Verify multer configuration

## 🧪 **Testing the Upload System**

### **Step 1: Test with Browser Console Open**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try uploading a photo
4. Look for debug messages

### **Step 2: Check Network Tab**
1. Go to Network tab in developer tools
2. Try uploading a photo
3. Look for the upload request
4. Check response status and data

### **Step 3: Verify Backend Logs**
1. Check backend terminal for console messages
2. Look for any error messages
3. Verify file is being saved

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Commands**

If uploads still don't work:

```bash
# Restart backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Restart frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Check upload directories
ls -la backend/uploads/
```

## 📝 **Expected Behavior**

### **Successful Upload:**
1. Frontend: Shows progress indicator
2. Backend: Logs upload request and file details
3. Database: Updates user's photo URL
4. Frontend: Shows uploaded photo immediately

### **Failed Upload:**
1. Frontend: Shows error message
2. Backend: Logs error details
3. User: Gets helpful error message

The debugging logs will help identify exactly where the process is failing!
