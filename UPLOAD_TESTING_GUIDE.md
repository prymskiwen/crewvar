## ✅ **Test Scenarios**

### **Basic Upload Test**
1. **Small Image** (< 1MB): Should upload quickly
2. **Large Image** (5-10MB): Should compress automatically
3. **Invalid Format** (.txt, .pdf): Should show error message
4. **Oversized File** (> 10MB): Should show size limit error

### **Drag & Drop Test**
1. **Desktop**: Drag image from file explorer
2. **Mobile**: Tap to select from gallery
3. **Multiple Files**: Try dropping multiple files (should handle first one)

### **Error Handling Test**
1. **Network Issues**: Disconnect internet during upload
2. **Server Errors**: Try uploading with backend stopped
3. **Invalid Files**: Try non-image files

## 🔧 **Technical Features**

### **Automatic Compression**
- **Before**: Large 5MB+ images
- **After**: Compressed to ~500KB-1MB
- **Quality**: 90% (high quality, optimized size)

### **File Validation**
- **Allowed Types**: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- **Size Limit**: 10MB maximum
- **Security**: Server-side validation

### **User Experience**
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during upload
- **Error Messages**: Clear, helpful error descriptions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Upload Fails**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
3. Check file size (must be < 10MB)
4. Ensure backend server is running

### **If Images Don't Display**
1. Check network connection
2. Verify image URL in database
3. Check file permissions in uploads folder

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The upload system is now complete and ready for production use! Users can:
- Upload profile photos of any reasonable size
- Add up to 3 additional photos
- Delete photos they no longer want
- Get clear feedback on upload status

The system automatically handles compression, validation, and error recovery, making it user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users.
